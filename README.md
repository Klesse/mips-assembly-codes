# üë®‚Äçüíª MIPS Assembly Codes

This assembly programs were made in Computer Architecture I classes in UFSCar to develop our knowledge about hardware and how to make code 
that interacts directly with the hardware.

## Codes

### Factorial

Calculates the factorial of any number given as input.

### Print Vector

A basic program that prints an entire vector values.

### Sum 2 Vectors

Sum two vectores element by element, creating a third vector with the sum.

### Sum

Sum of numbers and print them as output.

### Vector Index Sum

Sum of the vector index.

## Computer Architecture I - Overview

This subject in college was essential to learn about hardware and how it interacts with software. Besides the development of the 
[MIPS Processor](https://github.com/Klesse/mips-processor) this subjects focused also in assembly coding to create software that 
really needs undestanding about hardware, so it was perfect to learn about the MIPS architecure, focus of the classes.
